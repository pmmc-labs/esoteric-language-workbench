# Plan

Ghuloum's incremental approach: the compiler works and its tests pass at
the end of every step, and each step adds one feature. Steps are sized to
be a session or two each.

**Progress:** steps 0 and 1 are done; the mechanical checks came with 1. Next: 2, if the calculator needs it; else this is where the template rests.

Read [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) first. Where a step meets an **(open)**
item, propose options to the user before building (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Proposed layout

[The tree as planned. `CLAUDE.md` has the layout as built; when they
differ, this stays as a record of the plan.]

## Steps

Each step says what it adds, what it touches, what tests it adds, and
what it leaves out on purpose. A step marked **(done)** keeps its text,
with a note where what landed differs.

### 0. Scaffold (done)

- The build: `bin/langc.ts` reads a file, compiles it to C next to the
  output, and links it with `runtime/rt.c` by `cc` (`LANG_CC` overrides);
  `make test` runs the unit tests then the golden tests. C rather than
  assembly, so step 0 runs on any machine with a C compiler; a native
  target comes when the language needs one, through a target interface.
- The reader (`compiler/src/reader.ts`): integers, symbols and lists,
  each form with its line and column; `;` comments. Unit tests in
  `compiler/tests/`.
- A compiler for one kind of literal (`codegen.ts`): a program that is
  `42` compiles to a binary that prints `42`. Integers are 63 bits,
  shifted left one, tag 0 (`runtime/rt.h`); one past the range is a
  compile error, checked by a unit test since the golden runner calls a
  failed compile a failure.
- `t/run.sh`: compile each golden test, run it with the environment the
  tests assume (none yet; the knobs go there as the runtime gains them),
  compare stdout and stderr together with the `.expected` file, plus
  `exit: N` when the status isn't 0, `JOBS` at a time, with a watchdog.
- Golden tests 000 and 001, their outputs by hand.

Each step carries a **Size** line, the capability the step needs of
the agent that builds it, by `docs/MODELS.md`'s tiers: *large* where
there's a decision to propose, a runtime mechanism to design, or a
model to write; *medium* where the design is agreed and the step
describes its tests; *small* where the step is a pattern to repeat.
A session's first move is to compare its own model with the step's size.

### 1. Arithmetic (done)

Size: large, for the model and the decisions; medium once they're
written.

- `(+ a b)`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, nested, on 63-bit integers (D3, D4,
  D5); the runtime's checked operations in `runtime/rt.c`, the
  operator table in `codegen.ts`.
- Faults: overflow and division by zero end the program with a message
  and exit 1 (D6).
- `t/models/arith.py`: the operators over the edge values, Python's
  integers with the range and the division rule applied after. It
  writes tests 010 (every pair that gives a value, folded into one
  expression) and 011 to 015 (each a fault). The first version of the
  model folded a term before reducing it and overflowed: the compiler
  found the model's bug, which is the other half of why a model is
  worth having.
- The mechanical checks, `t/checks.py` (D8, D10): `models`, `tests`,
  `commits`, and the hook.
- Compile errors (arity, an unknown name, not an operator) as unit
  tests (D7).

### 2. [Immediates: the rest of the literals, if the calculator grows:
booleans and comparisons, say.] Size: medium.

### 3. [Conditionals.]

### 4. [Local bindings.]

### 5. [Heap values.]

### 6. [Procedures, calls and tail calls.]

### 7. [Closures.]

### 8. [Whatever the language is really about: its core rule.]

### 9. [The prelude, in the language.]

### 10. [Examples: ports of existing programs, each a golden test.]

### 11. [Tooling: the runtime cached, tests in parallel, the guide's
code checked.]

## Proposals

[Agreed proposals become steps above. Proposals not yet agreed go here,
each with its options and the agent's recommendation, marked
**proposed** until the person picks, and the pick recorded as a `Dn`.]
